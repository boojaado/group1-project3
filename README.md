# Project 3 Group 1: Hate Crime in the US 2015-2020


The purpose of this project was to create an interactive dashboard in a website. The group was able to exlore hate crime data on the US and render it through visualizations in a working website. Website contains Home Page, Dashboard page, Map Page, About Us Page, Source Data Page, & Citations Page. 


### Our Website Link

 - [Hate Crime Website](https://boojaado.github.io/group1-project3/website/dashboard.html)



### Home Page
Home page includes information on how hate crime is defined and resources for website visitors to help minimize hate crime in their community.

### Dashboard Page
The group used JSON to read in data and build the three dashboards page which may be filtered by year (shown on left of page).
The Lollipop chart (created using D3) shows incidents by offender race. The Lollipop chart has a tooltip when hovering over the circles. 
The bubble chart  (created using D3) shows number of incidents by bias type. The bigger the circle the greater the number of incidents for that bias type.
The 6 different colors are the region in the US where either incidents occured. This chart also has a hover over tooltip in each circle describing the bias type, number of incidents, and region. Lastly the bar graph (created using plotly) compares the number of incidents by the type of crime commited. The graph is sorted from greatest to smallest for ease of comprehension.

### Map Page
The group used GeoJSON to create the map below. The map has 4 layers allowing user to switch between their perfered map view. The number of incidents shown 
in the map may be filered by year, by using the filter to the left of the map. Hovering over each bubble in the map will
bring back a tooltip showing the state and total number of hate crime incidents that occured.

## Conclusion
The webiste invites users to form questions and explore the dashboards to 
answer those questions. We hope that users are able to learn about hate crime incidents that occur in the United States
and form their own conclusions using our dashbaords.
